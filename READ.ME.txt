SIC (Special Interest Categories) tag processing
Version: March 2022
Guidelines
1. Use file control_reg.py as template for future programs. This is the latest program design and 
    incorporates logging. Also, variable names and comments are updated.
    Earlier files are listed in order of creation:
        fraud.py
        forgery.py
        crime.py
        vcrime.py
        narcotics.py
        organised_crime.py
        absconder.py
        disqualified.py
        control_reg.py
    The earlier version are more limited (no argunante parse, many paramaters hard coded, code not optimised and common function not all
    separated). They could be upgraded for future processing of new files, which is not difficult, using control_reg as template. 
    It only takes a bit of time.
2. common.py contains classes and functions common to all programs (file read and write, argument parser, regex wrapper, logger)
     and must be imported in each individual sic program.
3. Tested with Python 3.10.1
4. Needs to have openpyxl installed (pip intall openpyxl)
5. Narcotics sits in it's own directory and uses common.py in that directory.
5. PharmList and NarcList Excel files contain triage data that is read by narcotics program
6. OrgCrimes Excel file contains triage data for organised crime and read by corresponding program.

The original triages and logic are not included here. There were several versions of each and I am not sure which one is the last one.
