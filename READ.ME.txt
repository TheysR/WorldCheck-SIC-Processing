SIC (Special Interest Categories) tag processing

Guidelines
1. Use file control_reg.py as template for future programs. THis is the latest program design and 
    incorporates logging. Also, variable names and comments are updated.
    Earlier files are listed in order of creation:
        fraud.py
        forgery.py
        crime.py
        vcrime.py
        narcotics.py
        organised_crime.py
        absconder.py
        disqualified.py
        control_reg.py
    The earlier version are more limited (no argunante parse, many paramaters hard coded, code not optimised and common function not all
    separated)
    They could be upgraded for future processing of new files, which is not difficult, using control_reg as tamplate. It only takes a but of time.
2. common.py contains classes and functions common to all programs (file read and write, argument parser, regex wrapper, logger)
3. Tested with Python 3.10.1
4. Needs to have openpyxl installed (pip intall openpyxl)
